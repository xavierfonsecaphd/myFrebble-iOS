# myFrebble-software
 This is the software I made for what now seems to be a deceased startup company (https://twitter.com/myfrebble). I host this project because I contributed pro-bono to the project, thus the entire IP of this project is mine.


You can access the page comenting on this failed project at https://www.engenheiros.pt/~oe84598/4.3.1-frebble.html, and the original tweet of the project as well https://twitter.com/myfrebble. You should try to contact the deceased company (if you can, https://github.com/HollandHaptics) to ask permission to use their code (https://github.com/HollandHaptics/SIDNFonds) other than my iOS app. 

For the iOS app, you're free to use, academically and otherwise, I let you :)
