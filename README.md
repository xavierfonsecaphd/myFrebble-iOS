# myFrebble-software
 This is the software of a what seems to be a deceased startup company (https://twitter.com/myfrebble). I host this project because I contributed pro-bono to the project, thus part of its IP is mine.


You can access the page comenting this failed project at https://www.engenheiros.pt/~oe84598/4.3.1-frebble.html
I do not hold IP rights over the overall software except for the iOS application that was coded by me. You should try to contact the deceased company (if you can) to ask permission to use everything here other than the iOS app code. With this being said, it seems this project was never duly licensed due to the absence of a license in this source code.

For the iOS, you're free to use, academically and otherwise, I let you :)
